# My Python Projects Journey 🐍

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This is a collection of mini-projects I’ve built while learning and practicing Python. Each project represents a step in my coding journey, from basic scripts to more advanced programs. The projects are organized into three levels based on their complexity.

## About This Repository 🗂️

This repository is a reflection of my progress in learning Python. It’s divided into three folders:

1. **Level 1**: Beginner-friendly projects that helped me grasp the basics of Python.
2. **Level 2**: Intermediate projects where I explored data manipulation, file I/O, and more structured programming.
3. **Level 3**: Advanced projects and mini-games that challenged me to think creatively and solve complex problems.

Each folder contains the code for the projects I’ve completed, along with a brief description of what I learned from each one.
